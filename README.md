# Airbnb Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict Airbnb listing prices based on various factors such as location, amenities, property descriptions, and more. By leveraging data science techniques, we provide insights that help hosts set optimal prices and improve revenue management.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Setting the right price for an Airbnb property is challenging. Prices that are too high can reduce bookings, while prices that are too low may lead to revenue loss. This project builds a machine learning model to assist hosts in making data-driven pricing decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementing **Linear Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning** to predict listing prices accurately.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Understanding price distribution across different locations.
- **Amenities Analysis:** Identifying key amenities that influence price variations.

## 📊 Business Impact
- Helps hosts optimize their pricing strategies.
- Provides data-driven insights for investment decisions.
- Enhances transparency for travelers looking for fair-priced listings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Visualization**: Geospatial mapping with Folium

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains Airbnb listings with various features such as location, price, amenities, and reviews. Due to data privacy, the dataset is not included in this repository but can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevezhenghp/airbnb-price-prediction/data?select=train.csv).
